Subject: Request for Salary Review

Dear Mr.dhananjay sir,

I hope you're doing well. I would like to take a moment to discuss my current compensation and request a salary review based on my contributions to the team and the company.

Over the past 3 years, I have taken on increasing responsibilities and successfully contributed to leadership and time management. I have also consistently received positive feedback from both colleagues and clients, which has motivated me to continue striving for excellence in my role.

Given these factors and considering industry standards for my position, I would like to discuss a potential adjustment to my salary. I believe this increase would reflect my continued dedication, hard work, and the value I bring to the team.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet and discuss this further. Please let me know a convenient time for us to sit down.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
